# [Find Nearest Right Node in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-nearest-right-node-in-binary-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree and a node u in the tree, return the nearest node on the same level that is to the right of u, or return null if u is the rightmost node in its level.  

Example 1:  

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,5,6], u = 4  
Output: 5  
Explanation: The nearest node on the same level to the right of node 4 is node 5.
