# [Leaf-Similar Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/)

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.  

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.  

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.
